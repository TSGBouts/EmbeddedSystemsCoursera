## Course Preface – Embedded Systems Assignments

This repository holds my solutions for the Coursera specialization **Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments** (University of Colorado Boulder) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Week 2 (Module 2):** Building a software development build system using GCC and GNU Make.
- **Week 3 (Module 3):** Exploring memory layout, segments, and how firmware maps into memory.
- **Week 4 (Final Assessment):** Integrating build system logic and memory-related code into a complete embedded firmware project.

Subsequent folders (e.g. `Week3/`, `Week4/`) will contain detailed READMEs and coding assignments for the corresponding modules.
